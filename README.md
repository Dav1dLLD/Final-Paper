Smoking is a normal hobby for some of the people, and from the investigation towards cigarettes, smoking is extremely bad for peopleâ€™s health with providing about 69 chemicals that would cause cancers. Therefore, National STEM Center from University of York has surveyed the UK smoking data from 1691 random people in UK. To be more specific, the survey contains the age of respondents, gender of respondents, the marital status of respondents, the nationality of respondents, the ethnicity of respondents, the income of respondents, the frequency of respondents and the type of cigarettes they are smoking. In this paper,with a reproducible way, I obtained some plots and tables, containing the results of the survey, and then I analyze the specific conditions of the demographic characteristics of smokers in UK.
